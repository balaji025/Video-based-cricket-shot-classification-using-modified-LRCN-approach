# Video-based-cricket-shot-classification-using-modified-LRCN-approach
This work shows the development of a deep learning model for cricket shot classification from video data, employing a modified Long-term Recurrent Convolution Network (LRCN) based model. 
This model achieved accuracies as high as 95% when trained. 
It involved designing and implementing the model's structure, incorporating layers such as LSTM and CNN to effectively capture temporal and spatial features from the video data. Each layer of the model features techniques such as BatchNormalization, MaxPooling2D, and Dropout. Additionally, the final layer is a Dense Output layer.
This work was presented at the IEEE SILCON 2024 conference held at NIT Agartala.
